    "content": "A Time for Reflection  For the first two years of my studies, I focused solely on the field of investment, immersing myself in the world of value investment, and reading books by successful investors, such as Warren Buffet and Peter Lynch. However, as I delved deeper into the subject, I began to ask myself two questions: “In an age overflowing with data, is an approach like value investing, which relies on qualitative analysis, still the answer for reasonable investment?”, “Is there a more rational method of solving the complex problem of investment?” I concluded that I needed a foundational understanding of mathematics and statistics, the bedrock of data science, to gain a broader perspective on, and possible solutions to, these questions. This prompted me to enroll in statistics courses and self-study probability and calculus. Thus, my journey towards AI began.Opening My Eyes to Reinforcement Learning  After my military service, I shifted my focus to club activities. At university, in the LIKELION Programming Club, I fortified my basic computer science knowledge by watching introductory lectures on the subject. As I was eager to experiment with diverse programming languages, I took on the role of team leader for the final project, being responsible for planning and web development. Subsequently, in the extracurricular SURI Investment Analysis Club, I formed a study group with fellow members who shared my interest in machine learning, particularly deep learning, to actively engage in knowledge exchange and networking.  As I studied deep learning, I came to realize that research papers provide the most important foundation for the field of AI, and I developed a strong interest in studies on reinforcement learning (RL), which solves complex problems through trial and error. I studied by running code via OpenAI Gym, and through online lectures such as the Berkeley Deep RL Bootcamp, and the DeepMind RL course by David Silver. I identified recent research trends through review papers and, after confirming that reinforcement learning is used in diverse fields, including finance, autonomous driving, robots, drones, and recommender systems, I developed a willingness to challenge complex problems in various domains. As my desire to study and research reinforcement learning in more depth grew, I began to dream of becoming a researcher in the field.Graduation and Regrets  As graduation approached, and my interest in reinforcement learning grew, I regretted not double majoring in computer science and not having an internship in a reinforcement learning research lab. I volunteered to teach Python to members of the SURI Investment Analysis Club. Then, as a Teaching Assistant on the Investment Theory course at Sungkyunkwan University, I had the opportunity to directly experience the teaching assistant system and tasks. Subsequently, I joined the Autonomous Driving Research Lab at Modulabs, studying how to solve path-planning problems using reinforcement learning. At the same time, I participated in Microsoft’s MS AI School to fill in my knowledge gaps, and I formed a self-study group, which under my leadership, jointly conducted a paper review and implemented code using Colab. As can be seen, I am constantly striving to pave my way towards becoming a researcher.Soon to Bloom “Potential”  Although I did not major in computer science, I believe that one of my strengths is my significant self-study in the field.  I also believe my leadership, sense of responsibility, and communication skills, which I gained through various activities where I took the role of leader, are strengths that can be significantly beneficial when conducting team projects in the future. Furthermore, my extroverted personality, nurtured through meeting diverse people and making friends while traveling to more than ten countries, including nine European countries, three Southeast Asian countries, Japan, and the United States, will also be of great help when networking within the research community.  Importantly, I believe that my biggest strength is the perseverance that has allowed me to take on the self-study challenge of learning about computer science and reinforcement learning, and I am confident it will be a great help in my future research endeavors. My two years of military service and the regular weight training I have done for three years since my discharge are proof that I am patient, can withstand progressive overload, and continue to work hard in the face of adversity. I hope to solidify my reinforcement learning knowledge base and research skills within the Master’s curriculum and then conduct in-depth research into developing and improving reinforcement learning algorithms through the PhD process.As I have done so far, I will calmly strive to find answers and never give up."
