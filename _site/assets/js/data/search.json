    "content": "Summary      Value investment, in the end, is also a pattern. It’s fundamentally no different from technical analysis.        If investment is based on patterns, let’s think probabilistically and statistically, and manage risk by adjusting our betting amount.        If not, let’s invest with the concept of ‘equity’, the essence of stocks.        If both seem unmanageable, let’s develop an investment artificial intelligence.        If that doesn’t seem right either, it’s best to be satisfied with the bank’s interest rate. Or, study hard to increase your own value.  IntroductionStudying various things seems to broaden my horizons and allows me to think diversely. Although I’m currently indifferent to becoming rich and don’t directly invest in stocks, I have gained confidence in my investment methods. Here are my thoughts.It’s been a while since I lost interest in direct investment. My value of life has changed significantly, and I thought that trading for a short-term price difference might be a gamble if it’s impossible to verify the possibility of profit probabilistically and statistically, no matter how solid logic one possesses.For instance, people usually expect the stock price to rise when the profits are high. But think about it, why should the stock price rise when the profits increase? Is the stock market a system that raises stock prices when profits rise? Absolutely not. Then, does all the profit go directly to the shareholders when the profit is high? This is also absolutely not the case. They don’t give all the profits as dividends. So, why should the stock price rise? In fact, there’s no reason. It just rises because many people buy it.In the end, the essence of stocks is supply and demand, and it’s a game where you can avoid defeat by buying in advance before the demand increases. But everyone’s logic for thinking that demand will increase is different, which is why technical investment and value investment were created. These investment methods are ultimately a problem of ‘interpretation of results’. Now, there are also people who try to forcibly increase demand, like the commonly mentioned ‘forces’ or ‘stock price manipulation’. In fact, as long as they can increase demand after purchasing stocks, they won’t lose. Of course, it would be a problem if it’s illegal.The ‘Real’ InvestmentAside from the act of forcibly increasing the stock price, I think all the actions trying to interpret the movement of the stock price and predict its direction are ultimately about ‘patterns’. Even value investment, which is considered a standard in investment, is one of the efforts to find patterns. Pursuing ‘profit’ is also a pattern about profit, and no matter what various valuation methods people talk about, it’s essentially not different from technical investment because it’s a story that ‘stocks that had such a trend made a profit’. But the problem is, it’s about proceeding on belief without statistical probability verification.After studying quant and backtesting various strategies, what I felt was, of course, it’s an obvious thing, but whether it’s value investment or technical investment, I think it’s hard to achieve a 100% win rate in the stock market if you invest based on ‘patterns’. Because no one knows how supply and demand will change, how can I know who will buy my stock for what reason in the future? And even if I’ve been right 100 times so far, I could be wrong on the 101st time.Of course, I think there can be patterns that are correct about 6 times out of 10, even if not up to 100%. The important thing, however, is being aware of the risk of this investment method. Whether it’s a valuation method or technical analysis, if you’re investing using a certain pattern in the end, I think you should invest managing risk and adjusting the betting amount, knowing that the win rate won’t be 100%. Wouldn’t a representative example be the Kelly Criterion?Otherwise, I think it’s right to invest with the concept of ownership of the company, the essence of stocks. The key is to buy the company when no one knows about it, when there’s only potential, and just HODL hoping that the company won’t go bankrupt until many people who find the company attractive appear. We can’t predict why people who want to buy my company find my company attractive. It’s just the buyer’s mind. Can Tesla’s early investors know why you bought Tesla?If you don’t think this is it either, I think the only remaining method is to create an investment AI. Anyway, AI friends will also find patterns in it, adjust weights, manage risk and invest in a way to maximize profits, but I think they can do it much better than people with emotions. But if you even think you can’t do this, then the bank is the answer. If you think about it, banks are a grateful existence. They hedge the inflation of many people without doing anything. If there is someone who is not satisfied with this interest rate and wants to become rich, they can study hard and raise their own value.ConclusionSome people may agree with this, and some may not. But at least for now, this is what I think. My perspectives on investing can change someday, but for now, I believe they are quite solid and close to the right answers.If I find a bit more free time and grow a bit more technically, I do want to create an investment AI someday. But it wouldn’t be for personal gain – I’d want to create an AI that anyone can comfortably use, like ChatGPT. Not everyone can be wealthy, but wouldn’t the number of people who lose money due to false information decrease? I would like to take on this challenge someday."

    "content": "A Time for Reflection  For the first two years of my studies, I focused solely on the field of investment, immersing myself in the world of value investment, and reading books by successful investors, such as Warren Buffet and Peter Lynch. However, as I delved deeper into the subject, I began to ask myself two questions: “In an age overflowing with data, is an approach like value investing, which relies on qualitative analysis, still the answer for reasonable investment?”, “Is there a more rational method of solving the complex problem of investment?” I concluded that I needed a foundational understanding of mathematics and statistics, the bedrock of data science, to gain a broader perspective on, and possible solutions to, these questions. This prompted me to enroll in statistics courses and self-study probability and calculus. Thus, my journey towards AI began.Opening My Eyes to Reinforcement Learning  After my military service, I shifted my focus to club activities. At university, in the LIKELION Programming Club, I fortified my basic computer science knowledge by watching introductory lectures on the subject. As I was eager to experiment with diverse programming languages, I took on the role of team leader for the final project, being responsible for planning and web development. Subsequently, in the extracurricular SURI Investment Analysis Club, I formed a study group with fellow members who shared my interest in machine learning, particularly deep learning, to actively engage in knowledge exchange and networking.  As I studied deep learning, I came to realize that research papers provide the most important foundation for the field of AI, and I developed a strong interest in studies on reinforcement learning (RL), which solves complex problems through trial and error. I studied by running code via OpenAI Gym, and through online lectures such as the Berkeley Deep RL Bootcamp, and the DeepMind RL course by David Silver. I identified recent research trends through review papers and, after confirming that reinforcement learning is used in diverse fields, including finance, autonomous driving, robots, drones, and recommender systems, I developed a willingness to challenge complex problems in various domains. As my desire to study and research reinforcement learning in more depth grew, I began to dream of becoming a researcher in the field.Graduation and Regrets  As graduation approached, and my interest in reinforcement learning grew, I regretted not double majoring in computer science and not having an internship in a reinforcement learning research lab. I volunteered to teach Python to members of the SURI Investment Analysis Club. Then, as a Teaching Assistant on the Investment Theory course at Sungkyunkwan University, I had the opportunity to directly experience the teaching assistant system and tasks. Subsequently, I joined the Autonomous Driving Research Lab at Modulabs, studying how to solve path-planning problems using reinforcement learning. At the same time, I participated in Microsoft’s MS AI School to fill in my knowledge gaps, and I formed a self-study group, which under my leadership, jointly conducted a paper review and implemented code using Colab. As can be seen, I am constantly striving to pave my way towards becoming a researcher.Soon to Bloom “Potential”  Although I did not major in computer science, I believe that one of my strengths is my significant self-study in the field.  I also believe my leadership, sense of responsibility, and communication skills, which I gained through various activities where I took the role of leader, are strengths that can be significantly beneficial when conducting team projects in the future. Furthermore, my extroverted personality, nurtured through meeting diverse people and making friends while traveling to more than ten countries, including nine European countries, three Southeast Asian countries, Japan, and the United States, will also be of great help when networking within the research community.  Importantly, I believe that my biggest strength is the perseverance that has allowed me to take on the self-study challenge of learning about computer science and reinforcement learning, and I am confident it will be a great help in my future research endeavors. My two years of military service and the regular weight training I have done for three years since my discharge are proof that I am patient, can withstand progressive overload, and continue to work hard in the face of adversity. I hope to solidify my reinforcement learning knowledge base and research skills within the Master’s curriculum and then conduct in-depth research into developing and improving reinforcement learning algorithms through the PhD process.As I have done so far, I will calmly strive to find answers and never give up."
