Great to meet you. My name is **Lucas Kim**. 

I am a student who would like to be a researcher in the field of Artificial Intelligence. 

My research interests include: ***Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning,*** and ***Decision Making***. I am aspiring to conduct research on reinforcement learning algorithms and also interested in applications of these techniques to real-world problems such as autonomous driving, robotics, recommender systems and investment.

I was an undergraduate at [Sangmyung University](https://www.smu.ac.kr/eng1/index.do) and majored in Business Administration. Currently, I applied for several US Computer Science master's programs. I would like to continue my studies in the US.

I am a deep thinker who enjoys engaging in open discussions. I always strive to share what I have learned and what I possess. This drives me to constantly seek opportunities for growth and to contribute towards a meaningful purpose.

If you wish to learn more about me, please feel free to review my [Personal History]() and [Curriculum Vitae]().

Thank you :)
