Great to meet you. 

I am student who would like to be a ***researcher*** in the field of Artificial Intelligence. 

My research interests include: ***Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning,*** and ***Decision Making***. I am also interested in applications of these techniques to real-world problems such as autonomous driving, robotics, investment and recommender systems.

I was an undergraduate and studied Business Administration at [Sangmyung University](https://www.smu.ac.kr/eng1/index.do). Currently, I applied for several US Computer Science master's programs. I would like to continue my studies in the US.
